Use of CORS: CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING
link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
What is the use of this thing in this project?

There are two backends 1.flask server 2.tfx server On the initial approach the request
from front end to get model prediction was handled by flask server and rerouted to tfx server.
So implying the tfx server to flask server as a local-host was of no issue. Even if the tfx-server
was in some remote instance(Refer to documentation/tfx_server_on_comppute_engine.ext) service can
be requested by using the external ip from fetch API. But issue arises when we have to bipass 
the backend flask server and send the request directly to tfx-server for optimal performance.
The flask server is serving the front end page so response from any domain which is not the flask server will be blocked
in front end by browser. So for cross origin resource we need to enable CORS setting in tfx-server side.
