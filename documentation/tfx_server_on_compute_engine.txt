This file contains information about how to deploy tfx-model-server at compute engine.
Cloud shell instances are volatile so if you are not working they are obliviated and your site goes down. So tfx-server should 
be deployed on something alwways running.

For this purpose we will create a compute engine instance.

Compute engine wont have the model files u stored in cloud shell. For that we have to list the
bucket objects for the project and move files from cloud shell to the bucket and access the bucket
in compute engine instance and move the file to the local directory of compute engine and run the tfx server.

IP forwarding will be off in the compute engine so switch it on by commands.

Use external IP address to send REST request to the tfx-server.

HTTP/HTTPS requests will be blocked by the compute engine by default because of the firewall
setting. Enable them by creating a new fire-wall rule by command to switch on the protocol
packets.
